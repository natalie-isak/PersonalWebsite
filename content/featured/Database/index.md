Along with two of my peers, I created a database management system in OCaml. Our system has
the capacity to read a CSV file and can perform a variety of functions. In particular, we can
read/add/delete rows/columns, encrypt/decrypt the csv, create scatter plots based on any two
rows within the CSV, generate variables, change the data file through multiplication/addition,
perform functions like mean/median/mode/standard deviation/variance on the data file or
variables, and perform statistical analysis on our data. Additionally, it updates the current file as
functions are performed on it and saves the current file. Specifically, I implemented the Rep_ok function, RSA encryption/decryption, and documenting/testing corresponding additions.
