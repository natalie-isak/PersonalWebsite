Our system has\nthe capacity to read a CSV file and can perform a variety of functions. In particular, we can\nread/add/delete rows/columns, encrypt/decrypt the csv, create scatter plots based on any two\nrows within the CSV, generate variables, change the data file through multiplication/addition,\nperform functions like mean/median/mode/standard deviation/variance on the data file or\nvariables, and perform statistical analysis on our data. Additionally, it updates the current file as\nfunctions are performed on it and saves the current file. Specifically, I implemented the Rep_ok function, RSA encryption/decryption, and documenting/testing corresponding additions. </p>"}
